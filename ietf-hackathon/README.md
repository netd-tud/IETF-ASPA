# AS_PATH Validation Algorithm

This python project has three different implementations of the `AS_PATH` verification algorithm.

- `simple.py` a simplified version
- `draft.py` implementation of the upstream and downstream formal procedure as described in draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-16 
- `optimized.py` an optimized version of the algorithm

`test.py` contains different test cases which are used to check for identical behavior.
